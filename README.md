## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend

npm start
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd my-react-app

```

### Run Both Frontend & Backend Concurrently (Recommended)
From the root folder, you can run both servers together using [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently):

This will start both the backend and frontend in development mode.
